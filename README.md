# Natours-Home-Page

Advanced home page built with CSS (Sass) only showing the power of CSS!

This project has:
- 7 sections, which some of them was built with the "clip-path" giving a different style in the background,
- A hamburger menu built with a 'check-box hack' (CSS only),
- Images and texts with animations,
- 'Card' container with information in the front and back,
- A cool background video, very smooth to the user,
- Advanced form using the beast of the 'background-image: linear-gradient',
- Different way to use the 'radio-button', exploring the pseudo-elements.

It was tested in Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Opera.
